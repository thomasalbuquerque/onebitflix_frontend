Frontend code repository for OneBitFlix, an online course platform for programming courses. It is a result of an exercise from the course Full Stack Javascript from OneBitCode company. I finished this course to learn how to make a Full Stack website with Typescript, Sass, NodeJS, Sequelize, Postgres, ReactJS, and NextJS. I plan to make the deployment of it soon.
